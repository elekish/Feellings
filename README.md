**E-Therapist: AI-Based Sentiment Analysis and Response Generator**

E-Therapist is an AI-based application that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis to provide supportive responses to user input. This project combines two crucial components:

**Sentiment Analysis**: E-Therapist utilizes a pre-trained sentiment analysis model to assess the sentiment of user text input. It can determine whether a user's message is positive, negative, or neutral, allowing it to respond empathetically to the user's emotional state.

**Response Generation**: The application generates thoughtful and contextually appropriate responses using a GPT-2-based language model. These responses take into account the user's sentiment, ensuring that the interaction is emotionally intelligent and empathetic.

How to Use E-Therapist
E-Therapist is designed as a Streamlit web application for ease of use. Users can input their messages, and the system will analyze the sentiment of the message and generate a supportive response. Whether someone wants to share their feelings, seek advice, or simply chat, E-Therapist is here to offer a comforting and friendly presence.
